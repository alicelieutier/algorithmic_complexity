# Algorithmic Complexity

This project explores algorithmic complexity, more specifically time complexity.

This was developed for Makers student, and is an implementation of this course (only accessible to Makers):

## Content

### Timing Framework

We are using time measures as a proxy for number of steps. This is not perfect for a number of reasons, but will give us some ideas about the types of complexity we encounter.

### Algorithms

A few different solutions for a range of problems with various complexities.

## Install

* Python3

## Problems and time series
